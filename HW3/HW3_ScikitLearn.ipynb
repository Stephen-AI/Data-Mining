    "* We will just do this on a single holdout test set (because it gets more complicated to put this inside of a cross-validation). So, split your data into training and test sets using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`. Do an 80/20 split.\n",
    "* Fit the Naive Bayes classifier to the training data by calling the `fit` method on the trainng data.\n",
    "* Now call the `predict_proba` method on your classifier and pass in the test data. This will return a 2D numpy array with one row for each datapoint in the test set and 2 columns. Column index 0 is the probability that this datapoint is in class 0, and column index 1 is the probability that this datapoint is in class 1.\n",
    "* We are going to say that class 1 (having the disease) is the rare/positive class. To create a ROC curve, pass the actual Y labels and the probabilites of class 1 (column index 1 out of your predict_proba result) into `sklearn.metrics.roc_curve`\n",

    "For some classification algorithms, scaling of the data is critical (like KNN, SVM, Neural Nets). For other classification algorithms, data scaling is not necessary (like Naive Bayes and Decision Trees). _Take a minute to think about why this is the case!!_ But using scaled data with an algorithm that doesn't explicitly need it to be scaled does not hurt the results of that algorithm."

    "Q10. The distance calculation method is central to the KNN algorithm. By default, `KNeighborsClassifier` uses  Euclidean distance as its metric (but this can be changed). Because of the distance calculations, it is critical to scale the data before running Nearest Neighbor!\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed why dimensionality reduction may also be needed with KNN because of the curse of dimensionality. So we may want to also perform a dimensionality reduction with PCA before running KNN. PCA should only be performed on scaled data! (Remember that you can also reduce dimensionality by performing feature selection and feature engineering.) \n",
    "\n",
    "An important note about scaling data and dimensionality reduction is that they should only be performed on the **training** data, then you transform the test data into the scaled, PCA space that was found on the training data. (Refer to the concept of [data leakage](https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-leakage-machine-learning/).)\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you are doing cross-validation, the scaling and PCA needs to happen *inside of your CV loop*. This way, it is performed on the training set for the first fold, then the test set is put into that space. On the second fold, it is performed on the trainng set for the second fold, and the test set is put into that space. And so on for the remaining folds. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this with scikit-learn, you must create what's called a `Pipeline` and pass that in to the cross validation. This is a very important concept for Data Mining and Machine Learning, so let's practice it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the following:\n",
    "* Create a `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` object to standardize the dataset’s features (mean = 0 and variance = 1). (Do not call `fit` on it yet. Just create the `StandardScaler` object.)\n",
    "* Create a `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` object to perform PCA dimensionality reduction. (Do not call `fit` on it yet. Just create the `PCA` object.)\n",
    "* Create a `sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier`. The number of neighbors defaults to 5 (k=5). Go ahead and change it to 7. (Do not call `fit` on it yet. Just create the `KNeighborsClassifier` object.)\n",
    "* Create a `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` object and set the `steps` to the scaler, the PCA, and the KNN objects that you just created. \n",
    "* Pass the `pipeline` object in to a `cross_val_score` as the estimator, along with the features and the labels, and use a 5-fold-CV. \n",
    "\n",
    "In each fold of the cross validation, the training phase will use _only_ the training data for scaling, PCA, and training the model. Then the testing phase will scale & transform the test data into the PCA space (found on the training data) and run the test data through the trained classifier, to return an accuracy measurement for each fold. Print the average accuracy across all 5 folds. "
